The entire application is build using React JS ans REST APIs.<br>
The application is divided into 4 stages.<br>
Stage I:<br>
The first stage involves setting up the react app using npx create-react-app my-app and then starting it using npm-start. In the next stage we use REST API command fetch which is connected to https://newsapi.org/ . We fetch the news object file from the website using the api key and according to the topic. The topic is given by the user using a input field and then stored in the variable $topic. The first 20 news data are stored in a list and displayed on the webpage.<br>
Stage II:<br>
Next, we create the sticky header using Javascript. Here we fixed the position and initialized top to 0. Also, the input field was moved in the sticky header as well.<br>
Stage III:<br>
Furthermore, we install dependencies lke npm install react-pro-sidebar, npm install react-icons--save, npm i react pro-sidebar react-icons and create a sticky sidebar with 5 menu items namely India, World, Media, Tech, Sports. When you click on sports, all the sports news around the world gets appended in our list. Same with the rest four. <br>
Stage IV:<br>
In this stage component deletion of the existing list when clicked on other components and other minor changes are made.<br>
